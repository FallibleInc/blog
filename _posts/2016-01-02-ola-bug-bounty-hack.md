OlaCabs (biggest competitor of Uber in India and a multi-billion dollar startup) has recently awarded a bounty of ₹65000 ($1000) and some electronic goodies for reporting a security vulnerability in one of their apps. The whole process of bug fixes on their part took around 2 months. The bug could have been exploited for monetary benefit, obtaining personal information of users and partial credit card information and transaction history. Since the bug affects a lot more number of companies where it is still not fixed, we would update the technical details later.
