OlaCabs (biggest competitor of Uber in India and a multi-billion dollar startup) has recently awarded a bounty of ₹65000 ($1000) and some electronic goodies for reporting a series of security vulnerabilities in one of their apps. The whole process of bug fixes on their part took around 2 months. The bugs could have been exploited for monetary benefit, obtaining personal information of users and partial credit card information and transaction history. Since the same set of bugs affects a lot companies where it is still not fixed, we would update the technical details later.
