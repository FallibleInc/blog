OlaCabs (biggest competitor of Uber in India and a multi-billion dollar startup) has recently awarded a bounty of ₹65000 ($1000) and some electronic goodies for reporting a security vulnerability in one of their apps. The whole process of bug fixes on their part took around 2 months. The bug could have been exploited for monetary benefit, obtaining personal information of users and partial credit card information and transaction history. Since the bug affects a lot more number of companies where it is still not fixed, we would update the technical details later.

It is encouraging to see startups creating bug bounty program in India and
actually making it work, sadly Ola is only one of the two companies we know of
who have a bounty program in India (other being payTM).
