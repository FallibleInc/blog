title: How fallible helps your startup
---

### Hypotheses -

- Startups have bugs, and could not focus much on security
- Automated security solutions do not discover all bugs. Good for XSS, bit of SQL injection check but not for logic flaws, payment check, etc.
- Security researchers who are good are expensive for startups to hire. > $500/hour

### Evidence -

- We sat down and discovered multiple vulnerabilites in more than 10 Indian startups who are each worth $100m+. Apart from these, we found several smaller startups that had bugs. We found a bug in a payment gateway/wallet service provider which is used by almost all ecommerce companies.

- Automated vulnerability scanners are decent for vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection etc. For dealing with situations where the outcome would be data leaks, problems in logic flow, payments etc. you need a capable security researcher.

- Security researchers are notoriously difficult to hire. Some of the better ones charge $500/hour and would easily rake up a bill of thousands of dollars for couple of days of work.


## The Solution -

We provide you an insurance against security bugs. You pay us a premium every month and we ensure that there are no bugs in your system. If an external security researcher finds a bug, we work with them and award them a bounty that would be decent even by international standards.

 - We test your setup including web & mobile clients, APIs, ops using exisiting and homegrown automation tools.
 - We deploy an on-premise intrusion alert system to let you know of any abnormal activity with your APIs
 - We run your bug bounty program where reputed researchers can submit bugs, we verify their reproducibility and then alert you. You can use the fallible platform to work with the researcher to get it fixed and then we pay the bounty. You do not have to pay anything except for our monthly subscription.
