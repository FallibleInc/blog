We started Fallible with the vision to help companies secure their systems from the bad guys. As such, we started with an introductory price to test the waters and get some feedback from pilot customers.

We are revising the pricing structure for Fallible, effective today. Our standard plan now comes at $1100/month and you get a discount of one month for prepaying the amount for the full year. The standard plan gives you access to our ever-expanding list of continous integration security tests every time you deploy your code and a basic support over email and phone. Apart from these, there is an option to let us manage your bug bounty program. The enterprise plan is meant for larger organizations that have stricter compliance policies and need for on-premise deployments or need dedicated support.

The revised pricing would allow us to develop the product in a much better way. Rest assured, we will keep your assets protected as before. You can always reach us at hello@fallible.co
